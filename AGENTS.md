# Agent guide

This app is built with kitr. Each section below is maintained by `kitr add`.

## kitr: conventions

- Import framework code from the `@kitr/*` package that `kitr add` installed (`@kitr/router`, `@kitr/query`, ...). Each re-exports the upstream library unchanged plus kitr helpers. `@kitr/kitr` is the CLI and the `kitrrc.ts` config (`@kitr/kitr/app`, `@kitr/kitr/env`).
- Where the app runs is a platform in `kitrrc.ts` (`platforms: { site: web({...}), api: server({...}) }`). `kitr dev <name>` / `kitr build <name>` / `kitr start <name>` run one or all; `kitr config <name> <option> <value>` edits options; native projects live in `platforms/<name>/`.
- Wiring lives in `kitrrc.ts` and `config/*.ts`; server code in `server/`. Generated files are written by `kitr generate` (types under `.kitr/`, the API route table), which `kitr dev`, `kitr build` and `kitr typecheck` run first; import the types from `#kitr/*`. Run `kitr doctor` after changes.

## kitr: structure

- Every kind of file has one home. `kitr make` lists them with the path each `kitr make:<kind> <name>` writes; create files with those commands instead of by hand.
- `app/` is what Vite bundles: pages, layouts, components, hooks, stores, queries, actions, validators, exceptions, providers, channels. `server/` is the standalone server and never imports React: controllers, services, middleware, jobs, mail. A declaration both sides read lives in `app/`.
- File names are kebab-case. The file carries a kind suffix exactly when its export does (`UsersController` in `users-controller.ts`, `BillingService` in `billing-service.ts`); `define*()` files have none (`server/jobs/send-receipt.ts`). Pages are named by their URL path.
- Group by feature inside the kind folder: `kitr make:controller admin/users` writes `server/controllers/admin/users-controller.ts`.
- Import across folders with `#app/*`, `#components/*`, `#server/*`, `#config/*`, `#kitr/*`; relative imports only inside one folder.

## kitr: router

- Routes are code: `app/routes.ts` is one `defineRoutes([router], (r) => r.root(...).page(...))` chain. `.page(path, { lazy })` adds a page, `.group(prefix, ...)` nests paths, `.layout(id, options, ...)` wraps pages without a path segment. `kitr make:page <path>` writes the page file and appends the link.
- Page components live in `app/pages/` and export a default component (or `definePage({ component, pendingComponent })`). Loaders, `beforeLoad` and `head` go on the route options in `app/routes.ts`; read loader data with `getRouteApi('<path>')` from `@kitr/router`.
- `app/document.tsx` renders the HTML document: TanStack Start streams it on the server (web `ssr`), prerenders it (`static`) or ships one shell (`spa`, desktop, mobile). Keep it platform-neutral.
- There is no `app/routes/` directory and no `routeTree.gen.ts`; `@kitr/vite` tells Start the tree comes from `app/routes.ts`.

## kitr: testing

- `npm test` runs Vitest. Components: `renderWithKitr(<X />, { app, queryData })` from `@kitr/testing/react`. APIs: `createTestClient(server).get('/api/x')`. No running backend is needed.

## kitr: vite

- `vite.config.ts` holds `kitr()` and nothing else: the plugin wires the router, React, Tailwind, `virtual:kitr/*` and the `#app`-style aliases from kitrrc.ts and the installed packages. Add a Vite plugin of your own next to `kitr()`.

## kitr: platform site

- `kitr dev <name>` runs Vite on the platform's port; `kitr build` writes `dist/<name>`; `kitr start` serves it (static files).
- Every route is prerendered at build time; data must be available at build or fetched on the client.

## kitr: analytics

- Track from components with `const analytics = useAnalytics<AppEvents>()` (`@kitr/analytics/react`) then `analytics.track('project.created', { id })`; declare new events in `app/analytics.ts` first.
- Page views are sent automatically on every route change. `analytics.identify(user.id, traits)` after sign-in, `analytics.reset()` on sign-out.
- Adapters live in `config/analytics.ts`; never call gtag/posthog directly.

## kitr: storage

- Persisted values are declared once in `app/storage.ts` (`defineStorage` for local/session storage, `defineCookie` for cookies) and never read through `localStorage`/`document.cookie` directly.
- Components: `const [value, setValue] = useStorage(item)` / `useCookie(item)` from `@kitr/storage/react`. Both are hydration-safe: the server and first render see the default.
- Server side (actions, controllers): `cookies(event).get(item)` / `.set(item, value)` from `@kitr/storage/server`; wrap the root route in `<CookieHeader value={request.headers.get('cookie')}>` so `useCookie` renders the right value during SSR.
- Add `schema` (zod/valibot) to validate what comes back from storage, `version` + `migrate` when a shape changes, `ttl` to expire.

## kitr: consent

- `app/components/consent-banner.tsx` is the one place consent is asked; mount it in the root layout. Analytics stays queued until its category is granted (`config/consent.ts`), so never call `analytics.enable()` by hand. Read a category with `useConsent().has('marketing')` before loading third-party scripts.

## kitr: state

- Client state only. `kitr make:store <name>` writes `app/stores/<name>.ts` using `createKitrStore`. Server data belongs in queries, not stores.

## kitr: seo

- `head: (ctx) => seo({ title, description }, ctx)` from `@kitr/seo` writes title, Open Graph, Twitter and canonical tags; `jsonLd({...})` adds structured data. Site defaults live in `config/seo.ts`.
- Use `...ssrRoute('data-only')` for heavy, non-SEO pages; `cacheHeaders({ sMaxAge })` for the CDN.

## kitr: theme

- Theme: `useTheme()` from `@kitr/theme` (`theme`, `resolved`, `setTheme`, `toggle`); `data-theme="light|dark"` on <html>. Put `<ThemeScript />` in the document head to avoid a flash.
- Colours and radii come from the `--kitr-*` variables (`@kitr/theme/styles.css`, overrides in `app/styles/tokens.css`); never hard-code them. Plain CSS helpers: `pick()`, `vars()`, `dataAttrs()` from `@kitr/theme`.
- Components live in `app/components/ui/` and are owned by the app: add more with `kitr ui add <name>` (shadcn-compatible registry).
- Icons: Hugeicons in the stroke-rounded style through `<Icon icon={Add01Icon} />` from `#components/ui/icon` (`kitr ui add icon`), icons from `@hugeicons/core-free-icons`. No other icon set, no emoji or glyphs as icons.

## kitr: animation

- Animate with `motion` from `@kitr/animation` (Motion for React), never `framer-motion` or `motion/react` directly. Spread a preset for enter/exit (`<motion.li {...presets.fadeUp} />`, inside `<AnimatePresence>` for exits) and use `transitions.fast|base|slow|snappy` instead of ad-hoc durations.
- Scroll-in sections use `<Reveal>` (`stagger` + `<RevealItem>` for lists). Page changes use `defaultViewTransition: pageTransitions()` in `app/router.tsx` with `import '@kitr/animation/page-transitions.css'`.
- Reduced motion is handled by `config/animation.ts`; don't check `prefers-reduced-motion` by hand.

## kitr: tailwind

- Tailwind v4: utilities map to kitr tokens (`bg-background`, `text-primary`, `rounded-md`). Use `cn()` from `@kitr/tailwind` to merge classes. Dark mode is `data-theme="dark"` on <html>, toggled by `useTheme()`.

## kitr: native

- Clipboard, share, haptics, geolocation, camera and biometrics come from `useNative()` / `useClipboard()` / `useShare()` / `useGeolocation()` in `@kitr/native/react`. Check `.supported` (or `canShare`) before showing a button; calling an unsupported capability rejects with `UnsupportedError`.

## kitr: content

- On this site the markdown is not in `content/`: `config/content.ts` reads a kitrjs/kitr checkout in `.content/kitr` (`npm run content:fetch`), with a collection per package (`pkg-<name>`). Load pages through `app/lib/content.ts` (`loadDoc`, `loadGuide`, `loadPackagePage`), which maps them to the site's addresses.
- Pages are markdown in the folders `config/content.ts` lists (`content/docs/*.md`, served at `/docs/<slug>`). Each starts with `title` and `description` frontmatter; the collection's `nav.json` orders and groups them, and a page missing from it is not built.
- `kitr generate` (run by `kitr dev`, `kitr build` and `kitr typecheck`) renders the markdown into `.kitr/content/`. Never edit those files; edit the markdown.
- Load a page in the route's loader in `app/routes.ts`: `const page = await loadPage('docs', params.slug)` with `loadPage` from `#kitr/content`, and `throw notFound()` when it is `null`. Render it with `<DocBody page={page} />` from `@kitr/content/react`. `nav.docs` from `#kitr/content` is the sidebar; `Slug<'docs'>` types a slug.
- Markdown extras: `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!WARNING]` callouts; a first code line `// app/routes.ts` becomes the caption; a `sh` block of `kitr ...` lines becomes a command block; `## 1. Step` headings are numbered steps; link other pages as `./other-page.md`.
